# Send Virtual Hugs

## Inspiration
Connecting with loved ones is so important, especially during a hard time like this. It's not just a "feel-good" kind of a thing. You and your loved ones will be happier and healthier by being connected. But what should we do if we cannot meet face to face to give hugs like we used to? When you are busy, it is hard to set a time to reach out to connect by phone, FaceTime, or Zoom. 

## What it does
SEND VIRTUAL HUGS! If you put down the contact information of your loved ones, we will help you to stay connected with them. Don't worry. We will make sure that their information is securely saved.
Social connectedness is often overlooked but is truly crucial in psychological health. Would you like to learn more about why being connected is important to you? 

## How we built it
We used NextJS, Vercel, Typescript, Styled-Components, and React-Hook-Form

## Challenges we ran into
- Doing everything remotely for the first hackathon.
- Coming up with ideas and scope small enough to be able to get done within a constrained time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy that we could successfully provide feedback, which was the most critical part of our application idea. 

## What we learned
- learned a lot about Auth0, Vercel, and NextJS

## What's next for Send Virtual Hugs
We would like to add log in function as well as contact import. Log in function will enable users to keep track of their information. Also, contact import function will help users so that they don't have to type email address.
